            Iâ€™m a BCA student who knows exactly how stressful and confusing
            college life can be â€” assignments, exams, practicals, and trying to
            find proper study material all at once. Thatâ€™s why I built{" "}
            <strong>StudyOU</strong> â€” a simple, platform to help fellow BCA
            students like you save time and study smarter.

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            My mission is to make BCA resources more accessible and reliable â€”
            notes, previous year papers, important questions, mini projects, and
            more â€” all in one place, without distractions.

            Why I Built This
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            I struggled to find good notes and real project ideas during my
            semesters. Most websites were either outdated, full of ads, or just
            plain unhelpful. So I decided to create my own â€” organized, simple,
            and always improving.
